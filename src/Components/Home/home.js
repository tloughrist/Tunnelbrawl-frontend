          <h2>Deep underground, rival clans of dwarves expand their tunnels,  searching for more gems and precious metals. When their tunnels collide, the entire clan mobilizes, rushing to the tunnels to claim the contested territory. When three or four tunnels intersect, an all-out melee ensues...</h2>
          <h1 className="centered">...a TUNNEL BRAWL!</h1>
          <p><b>Tunnel Brawl</b> is a modified form of chess for two to four players.</p>
          <p>Each player takes charge of a clan of dwarves fighting for territory. A clan is made up of eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, a queen, and a king.</p>
          <p>At the start of the game, each player has four pawns at the mouth of their tunnel and four random pieces in reserve.</p>
          <p>Each turn, if there is room in a player's tunnel mouth, they will place a reinforcement from their reserve into an open square in their tunnel mouth. The reserves will then be replenished back to four pieces for as long as unplaced pieces remain in the clan.</p>
          <p>The game ends when all kings but one have been captured.</p>

                  <p>Pawns move one square, with the exception of their first move when they may move up to two squares.</p>
                  <p>If there is a a piece between the pawn's starting square and ending square &#40;a situation that can only arise on their first move&#41;, they cannot take that move.</p>
                  <p>Pawns capture on the diagonal. If there is an enemy piece one square diagonally from the pawn's starting square, even if that piece is diagonally behind the pawn, the pawn can capture that piece, replacing it on the board.</p>
                  <p>For those familiar with the rules of chess, pawns in Tunnel Brawl cannot capture en passant. Pawn promotion also does not occur in Tunnel Brawl.</p>

              <div>
                <p>If a player has no pieces in reserve, their tunnel mouth collapses, blocking each empty square in the tunnel mouth. If any of the squares in the tunnel mouth are occupied, they become blocked as soon as they are no longer occupied.</p>

              <h3>Queen Defection</h3>
              <div>
                <p>When a player capture's a king, the queen of the losing clan defects to the capturing player's clan. This is true even if that queen has already been captured.</p>
                <p>If there are any empty squares in the capturing player's tunnel mouth, a new queen will immediately appear in one of the squares.</p>
                <p>If there are no empty squares in the capturing player's tunnel mouth, a new queen will appear as soon as a square becomes unoccupied.</p>
                <p>If the there are no empty squares in the capturing player's tunnel mouth because the tunnel has collapsed, a new queen will appear in one of the squares of the tunnel mouth. The square will fill with rubble as soon as the square is empty again.</p>

              <h3>Locking</h3>
              <div>
                <p>A situation can arise where a player is unable to make any legal move. In that case, that player forfeits the move phase of their turn.</p>
                <p>Likewise, if a player's tunnel mouth is completely occupied during the placement phase of their turn, they forfeit that phase.</p>
